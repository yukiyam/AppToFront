AppToFront
==========

What's this?
------------

Brings all windows of an application to front (like when switching applications
by Cmd-Tab or by clicking a dock icon) when the application's window is clicked 
while it is in background.


Supported OS Versions
---------------------

Theoretically, AppToFront can be built for any version of Mac OS X/macOS up to 
11.0 Big Sur. However my PowerBook has crashed last summer so I have't tested it
on a PowerPC machine...


How to build
------------

I have confirmed that Xcode 6.4 to 12 builds the project with little to no 
modifications.
It will work with or without sandbox environment.

AppToFront supports AppleScript. Running
'''set enabled of app "AppToFront" to false'''
will temporarily disable the app's functions.

You can build it as a background application by setting Info.plist's LSUIElement
to YES. In this case, run AppleScript 'tell app "AppToFront" to quit' when you
want to quit the application.


How to build on earlier systems
-------------------------------

If you can't open MainMenu.xib...

1. Create a new MainMenu.xib/.nib.
2. Make some decent main menu.
3. Set the class of File's Owner to MyApplication or NSApplication.
4. Add an AppDelegate object and connect it to File's Owner's delegate outlet.
5. Save.

Earlier Xcode/ProjectBuilder may not be able to open the project. If so,

1. Make a new empty project.
2. Add a Cocoa application target.
3. Add files in AppToFront directory.
4. Change build settings until it works correctly. 
    - Specifically, you must turn off ARC if the option is available.

To target Mac OS X 10.3 and earlier, you must make .scriptSuite/
.scriptTerminology files from AppToFront.sdef. 'sdp' command may do the job but
you must hand-generate them if it does not work. Read Cocoa Scripting Guide for 
details.

Have fun!
